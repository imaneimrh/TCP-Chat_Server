# Developer 2 - Package Summary

## Components Implemented

### 1. Client Interaction
- Message parsing and command handling
- User-to-user direct messaging
- Room-based message broadcasting

### 2. Room Management
- Room creation and joining functionality
- Room listing and management
- Multi-user chatrooms

### 3. File Transfer (Basic Implementation)
- Protocol for sending/receiving files
- Progress tracking
- Chunked file transfer

## Package Structure

### `shared` Package
Contains common types and interfaces used across components:
- `Message` struct for all communication
- `Client` struct for client connection representation
- Message type constants

### `client` Package
Handles client connections and message processing:
- `handler.go`: Manages client connections
- `message.go`: Parses and formats messages
- `filetransfer.go`: Handles file transfer operations

### `room` Package
Manages chat rooms:
- `room.go`: Individual room implementation
- `manager.go`: Manages multiple rooms

### `cmd/testclient` Package
A simple test client for verifying functionality

### `test` Package
Integration tests for the implemented components

## How to Test

1. Run the integration tests to verify component functionality:
   ```
   go test ./test
   ```

2. To manually test, you'll need to integrate with the server component from Developer 1:
   ```
   # Run the server (Developer 1's component)
   go run main.go
   
   # Run the test client in a separate terminal
   go run cmd/testclient/main.go localhost 8080 testuser
   ```

## Supported Client Commands

- `/join <room>` - Join a chat room
- `/leave <room>` - Leave a chat room
- `/create <room>` - Create a new chat room
- `/list` - List available rooms
- `/msg <user> <message>` - Send a direct message to a user
- `/file <user> <filename>` - Send a file to a user (when implemented)

## Integration Points with Developer 1

1. **Authentication**:
   - Developer 1 will handle user authentication
   - After authentication, your `Handler.HandleClient()` function should be called

2. **Server Setup**:
   - Developer 1 will create the TCP listener
   - Your components expect authenticated clients to be passed to the handler

3. **File Transfer**:
   - Basic implementation is provided
   - Will need to integrate with Developer 1's server component for full functionality
